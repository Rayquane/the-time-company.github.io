									<h1>About us</h1>
								</header>
								<h2>Creators</h2>
								<p><u>Rayquane</u> : I'm a very, very, extremely big fan of the character of N. Tropy, since the year of 2017. It's my favorite character
								even, accross all medias. I discovered the character by playing Warped, and got attached to precisely Sir Tropy by playing him in CTR,
								but I already loved the other interpretations of the character in general. My favorite is Sir Tropy in N. Sane Trilogy.<br/>
								I do renders, drawings, fanfics and essays, and just a ton of research about the character in general.</p>
								<p><u>Queen's 1# fan</u> : As they want to keep being anonymous, I, as Rayquane, will present them. They are the most
								respectful fan about Lady Tropy. They are the most respectful fan about Lady Tropy. They help me with the website, and they are the person
								who even gave me the idea of creating it. I thank them infinitely for their powerful support.
								
								<h2>Questions</h2>
								<h3>Why was this website created ?</h3>
								<p>It's an idea that came from fun discussions between the two of us. As Nefarious Tropy fans, we saw the community absolutely
								not respecting them in general. I, as Rayquane, thought of a kind of a tribute website. Something to talk about their legacy, who they are, factually, while respecting them.<br/>
								We think the community and the most recent developers, as of the end of 2024 (Toys for Bob who did IAT and Rumble), didn't give them justice and support.</p>

								<h3>Why are the terms Male Tropy, Female Tropy and Prime Tropy not used ?</h3>
								<p>We find the two first terms to be degrading and not respectful about the interpretations of the character and prefer
								to not use them, as it's only refering to them by their gender. They are two different interpretations, not just two N. Tropy
								in two different genders.<br/>
								The term of Prime Tropy, as much as it is factual that Sir Tropy existed before Lady Tropy, makes it feels like Lady Tropy
								is inferior to Sir Tropy.</p>

								<h3>What are the terms used then ?</h3>

								<p>To compare them :<br/>
								- Sir Tropy and Lady Tropy<br/>
								- N. Tropy and N. Tropy (Alt)<br/><br/>

								Otherwise, we simply use Doctor Nefarious Tropy for both of them.
								</p>
								<h3>Why is N. Tropy from Crash Bandicoot 4 : It's About Time not presented in the site at all ?</h3>

								<p>We'll keep it simple and honest : this is not N. Tropy.</p>

								<h3>Can I contribute ?</h3>

								<p>As we lost faith in the community... No.</p>

								<h3>Hey, she didn't create the Rift-</h3>

								<p>Oh we indeed reinterpreted that part, as that other reinterpretation got shafted. We think it should be her that created it.</p>
